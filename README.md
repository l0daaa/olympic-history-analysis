# 🏅 Olympic Athletes Data Analysis

This is my **first data analysis project** using Python and the Pandas library.  
I built it to learn and practice the basics of working with real data.

The dataset I used is from Kaggle:  
👉 [120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

## 📌 What I Did

I split the project into **6 phases** to learn step-by-step, like in a real bootcamp:

### ✅ Phase 1: Load the data  
- Loaded the CSV file using Pandas  
- Explored the shape, columns, and data types  

### ✅ Phase 2: Clean the data  
- Filled missing values in `Height` and `Weight` using the median  
- Dropped unnecessary columns  
- Checked for duplicates and fixed errors  

### ✅ Phase 3: Explore the data  
- Found top countries by medal count  
- Filtered for athletes who won medals  
- Looked at Egypt's history in the Olympics  

### ✅ Phase 4: Ask and answer real questions  
- Which countries and sports got the most medals?  
- How does age relate to medals in different sports?

### 🟡 Phase 5: Advanced Pandas (Still in progress...)  
- Working on pivot tables and custom columns  
- Creating age groups and summaries

### 🟡 Phase 6: Save & Publish (Still in progress...)  
- Planning to save the final cleaned data  
- Finalize visualizations and share the project
